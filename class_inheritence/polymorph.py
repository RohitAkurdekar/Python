# What is Polymorphism in Python?
# Polymorphism in Python is the ability of an object to take many forms.
#  In simple words, polymorphism allows us to perform the same action in many different ways.

def polymorph():
    students = ['Emma', 'Jessa', 'Kelly']       #list
    school = 'ABC School'                       #string

    # calculate count
    # same function but different type of parameters
    print(len(students))        #list
    print(len(school))          #string
